- i learnt basic elements of html, but writing this a few days after i learnt it and with sufficient practice, i learnt that the familiarity and daily practice helps commit these details to long term memory. even so, i will continue to document what i've learnt immediately as much as i can. most of what i've learnt here, i learnt again in fcc and my records of what i've learnt are more in detail in the other repositories.
